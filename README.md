- 👋 Hi, I’m @laurynsmithbrander
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about code so I can be a better UX'er.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics of code.  I am a total beginner, and I consider myself knowing nothing.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to be better at collaborating with developers and engineers, if only by being more fluent in their language, and better understanding technical capabilities.
